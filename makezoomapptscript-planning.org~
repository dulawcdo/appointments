#+TITLE: Planning Docs - Make Zoom Appt Script

This script will help me accomplish the following:
- schedule zoom meetings for Eric or Andrea
- input will be of one of two kinds:
  * info from appt request email
  * manual entry of info
   
* Input Style
The program asks whether we would like to pull from a pasted appointment request input, or individually request the appointment details.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

print("Input method? [a]Appt request / [m]Manual")
x = raw_input()

#+END_SRC

* IF: Appt Request Input
- ask user to paste input
- extract counselor name
  - set counselor name variable
  - set counselor email variable
- extract student name
  - set student name variable
- extract date and time
  - set date variable
  - set time variable
  - set AM / PM variable

#+BEGIN_SRC python

# USING APPOINTMENT DETAILS pulled from email via emacs function send-appt-to-shell()

x = "a" 
if x == 'a':
    with open('rawappt.txt') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        apptint = 0
        for line in lines:
            x,y = line.split(':', 1)
            print(y.strip())
            apptint += 1
            if apptint == 1:
                counselorname = y.strip()
            elif apptint == 2:
                apprawtime, appdate = y.strip().split("on")
                apptime, appampm = apprawtime.strip().split(" ")
            elif apptint == 3:
                studentname = y.strip()

               

# print("Now for the results . . .")
# print("The counselor is "+counselorname)
# print(appdate)
# print(apptime)
# print(appampm)
# print("The student is "+studentname)







              
    
    # Pending, how to parse the input
    #  Counselor: Andrea Montague                                                                                     
    #  Time: 1:00 PM on Sep 23, 2020                                                                                  
    #  Appointment Type: Initial Meeting (2L & 3L)
